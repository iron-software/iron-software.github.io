    "keywords": "IronBarCode - The BarCode and QR Library for .NET IronBarcode allows developers to read & write Barcodes and QR Codes within .NET Applications & websites. The .NET Barcode Library reads and writes most Barcode and QR standards. These include code 39/93/128, UPC A/E, EAN 8/13, ITF, RSS 14 / Expanded, Databar, CodaBar, Aztec, Data Matrix, MaxiCode, PDF417, MSI, Plessey, USPS, and QR. The barcode result data includes type, text, binary data, page, and image file. Barcode reading engine includes automatic image correction and barcode detection technology to take the pain out of locating and reading from imperfect scans. Multithreading, cropping, and batch scanning provides fast and accurate scanning of multi page documents. The barcode writing API checks and verifys format, length, number, checksum to automatically avoid encoding errors. Barcode writer allows for styling, resizing, margins, borders, recoloring, and adding text annotations. Barcodes can be written to image, PDF or HTML file. Key library features include: Read single or multiple Barcodes and QR Codes from images or PDFs. Image correction for skewing, orientation, noise, low resolution, contrast etc. Create barcodes and apply to images or PDF documents. Embed barcodes into html documents. Style Barcodes and add annotation text. QR Code Writing allows adding of logos, colors, and advanced QR alignment. IronBarcode can be used within C#, Visual Basic .NET, ASP .NET projects, MVC, Web Services, Console & Desktop Applications. Get Started Reading and writing barcodes only requires a single line of code with IronBarCode.

Along with the related EAN barcode, the UPC is the barcode mainly used for scanning of trade items at the point of sale, per GS1 specifications. Please Note: UPCA may only encode numerical (digits) content of length 12 or 13 digits long. Shorter Barcodes will have trailing zeros (000) prepended to the start of the number automatically.

BarCodeAspectSide Chooses the side of barcode to keep aspect size using IronBarCode. This enum is related to BarCodeAspectSide with the side to keep. BarcodeEncoding Barcode Encoding Types. Setting a BarcodeEncoding when reading Barcodes improves performance by only looking for expected barcode types. Setting a BarcodeEncoding when rendering Barcodes chooses the type and design of barcode to be generated. For barcode creation please also see the BarcodeWriterEncoding Enum which omits barcode formats which are not writable with IronBarCode. BarcodeOrientation Specifies the orientation of a Barcode. BarcodeReader A versatile static class for reading many popular barcode formats from Images and PDFs. IronBarCode.BarcodeReader supports barcode reading from Bitmaps, Image Objects, Image Files, Image Streams, MultiFrame Tiff Images and also PDFs. Features: Crop-area support, Image filters, and preprocessing for improved accuracy including and the ability to automatically un-rotate, deskew and clean barcode image input. BarcodeReaderOptions An Options class of BarcodeReader for reading many popular barcode formats from Images and PDFs. Features: MaxParallelThreads, Reading detail, ExpectMultipleBarcodes, Crop-area, Image filters and preprocessing for improved accuracy. BarcodeResult Result from reading a barcode using IronBarCode BarcodeResultPosition Represents the position of the detected barcode code in the image. BarcodeResults Result from reading a barcode as IEnumerable using IronBarCode BarcodeScanMode Define how IronBarcode scans and detects barcodes in an image to read. By default, a ML model will scan the image, and a basic second scan will be run if the ML model finds none. BarcodeWriter A static class allowing for barcode images of many types to be generated dynamically. Generated Barcodes can be exported as Images, Bitmaps, Files, PDFs and Streams. BarcodeWriterEncoding Chooses the style of barcode to render as an image using IronBarCode. This enum is related to BarcodeEncoding with the exception that only encodable barcode formats are mentioned. As this Enum is not of the Flags type, only one BarcodeWriterEncoding can be used to generate a barcode, which is logical. BinaryThresholdFilter A filter to applied the binarization to the image splitting the pixels at the given threshold with Luminance as the color component to be compared to threshold. BrightnessFilter A filter for adjust image brightness. ContrastFilter A filter for adjust image Contrast.

Generated Barcodes can be exported as Images, Bitmaps, Files, or Streams. DataMatrixWriter.DataMatrixShape Enumeration for DataMatrix shape. Can specify if you would like a Square (equal width and height) or Rectangular . GeneratedBarcode A barcode generated by IronBarCode. In addition to exporting the barcode as a graphic, we may also resize it, recolor it and annotate it with this class using fluent notation. GeneratedBarcodes may be exported as Images, Objects or PDF files. They may also be exported as HTML for use on the web. ImageFilterCollection A collection of ImageFilter for processing Image. Installation A directory with write-access where setup and temporary files and will be deployed when necessary. InvertFilter A filter for inverts the colors of the image.

QRCodeWriter A class allowing for advanced control on the generation of QR type barcodes. QRCodeWriter gives the developer access to set QR code error correction levels, and to add logo images to QR codes. Generated Barcodes can be exported as Images, Bitmaps, Files and Streams. QRCodeWriter.QrErrorCorrectionLevel The ErrorCorrection or fault tolerance level of a QR code. A higher QRCodeWriter.QrErrorCorrectionLevel create more complex QR codes, which are less prone to reading errors. They may also be readable if damaged or partially obscured. Please also see http://www.qrcode.com/en/about/error_correction.html ReadingSpeed Specify the reading speed of IronBarcode. Setting a more detailed option will use more CPU and take longer. Please understand that pre-processing is CPU-heavy and we recommend experimenting with different settings starting with the lowest settings first and gradually working up from there.

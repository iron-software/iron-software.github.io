This library adds OCR functionality to Desktop, Console and Web applications in minutes. IronOCR's Unique Features: Pure .Net OCR API All OCR tasks run locally (no SAAS) 125 languages Barcode & QR Code reading Corrects low quality, noisy and distorted scans Performance tuned above and beyond any other known build of Tesseract OCR. Reads PDFs Can export searchable PDF documents from OCR Reads multi-page TIFFs Can save any OCR Scan to a searchable PDF document or XHTML Data output options include: Plain Text, Barcode Data and an OCR Result class containing paragraphs, lines, words, and characters. Language Support 125 Languages including: Arabic, Chinese, English, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish... Custom language packs can also be created. Get Started Quickstart : https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/ Install With NuGet : https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronOcr/ Compatibility IronOcr provides Tesseract OCR on Mac, Windows, Linux, Azure and Docker for: .Net Framework 4.0 + .Net Standard 2.0 + .Net Core 2.0 + .Net 5 Mono for MacOS and Linux Xamarin for MacOS C# Code Example using IronOcr; var Ocr = new IronTesseract(); Ocr.Language = OcrLanguage.English; using (var Input = new OcrInput(\"image.png\")) { // Input.Deskew(); // use if image not straight // Input.DeNoise(); // use if image contains digital noise var Result = Ocr.Read(Input); Console.WriteLine(Result.Text); } Further Documentation Code Samples : https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/examples/simple-csharp-ocr-tesseract/ API Reference : https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/object-reference/api/ Tutorials : https://ironsoftware.com/csharp/ocr/tutorials/how-to-read-text-from-an-image-in-csharp-net/ Support : developers@ironsoftware.com"

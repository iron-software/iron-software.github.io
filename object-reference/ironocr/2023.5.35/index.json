You may use any combination of these flags to enable logging. IronTesseract IronTesseract is a comprehensive managed class for performing Tesseract OCR in .Net applications. IronTesseract natively supports Tesseract 3, 4 and 5 engines, and will automatically install all required binaries and language packs (tessdata) files. License Allows IronOCR license keys to be applied globally across an application. OcrFilters A collection of OCR Image filter for processing Images. OcrInput OcrInput provides a robust class for preparing one or more Image Files, PDFs, IronSoftware.Drawing.AnyBitmap, SixLabors.ImageSharp.Image, System.Drawing.Bitmap, other famous image library Objects, Streams and Binary Image data for OCR. Instances of OcrInput can be read by the IronTesseract class. We recognise that much of the quality of OCR results depends on preparing images to be read. This class allows developers to enhance their scanned documents provide faster, more accurate OCR results using filters such as: EnhanceResolution(Int32) , DeNoise(Boolean) , ToGrayScale() , IronOcr.OcrInput.Deskew(IronOcr.OcrLanguage,System.Int32,IronOcr.OrientationConfidence) , Rotate(Double) and Sharpen() . Supports for multi-paged OCR input. OcrInput.ImageType Type of Image to save as. Common examples are PNG , JPG , and GIF . OcrInput.Page A full page (one image) within an OcrInput object. OcrInputFilterWizard OcrInputFilterWizard provides a brute-force filter assessment tool to try filter combinations within IronOCR to get the highest IronTesseract confidence. Simply call the Run(String, out String, out Double, IronTesseract) method with a image filepath, and optionally a Tesseract. Out variables include the result of the best combination's read, and the best confidence. Example use: var results = OcrInputFilterWizard.Run(\"img.png\", out string text, out double confidence); OcrLanguage The natural language in which OCR documents will be read. Any number of languages may be used simultaneously using the IronTessseract.AddSecondaryLanguage() Method. To use a custom Tesseract language file (.traineddata) please see the IronTessseract.UseCustomLanguageFile() Method OcrReadTask OcrResult A full document object model (DOM) for results when IronTesseract reads an image or OcrInput . Gives access to Text, Pages, Words, Paragraphs, Lines, Words, Characters, Images, Barcodes, Coordinates, Font information in granular detail. OcrResult.Barcode Represents a barcode discovered during OCR. See ReadBarCodes which must be set true to use this feature. OcrResult.BarcodeEncoding Barcode Encoding Types. OcrResult.Block Represents a block of text containing zero or more paragraphs. OcrResult.Character Represents a single character (char) of text. OcrResult.Choice OcrResult.Line A line of text within an Paragraph OcrResult.OcrFont Detailed font information returned when using Tesseract OEM engine modes. OcrResult.OcrResultElement Lowest level of abstract OcrResult DOM element. All result objects extend from this including OcrResult.Barcode , OcrResult.Character , OcrResult.Word , OcrResult.Line , OcrResult.Paragraph ... OcrResult.OcrResultTextElement An abstract class representing discovered OCR DOM text elements such as OcrResult.Character , OcrResult.Word , OcrResult.Line , OcrResult.Paragraph ... OcrResult.Page Represents a single page within an OcrResult object. OcrResult.Paragraph Represents a paragraph of text with an OcrResult object. OcrResult.TextFlow Describes text direction OcrResult.Word Represents a Word discovered during OCR. OpenCvClient Client layer for OpenCV interop OrientationConfidence ResultHighlightType ResultHighlightType defines what highlighting mode to use for HighlightTextAndSaveAsImages(IronTesseract, String, ResultHighlightType) . You may choose to highlight every character, word, line, or paragraph. TesseractConfiguration A configuration object that fine-tunes Tesseract behavior at an Instance level. Gives access to every option available to tesseract command line or C++ API users. TesseractEngineMode Allows the developer to choose the algorithm Tesseract will use for OCR. TesseractAndLstm is the recommended behavior for IronOCR. TesseractPageSegmentationMode Page segmentation mode defines how your text will be searched for by Tesseract. TesseractVersion Selects between different binary versions of Tesseract."

This is very useful for OCR because Tesseract tolerance for skewed scans can be as low as 5 degrees.

Required when using the Rotation filter. Rotate System.Int32 MaxDeskewAngle Optional MaxDeskewAngle amount when using the Deskew filter. Defaults to 45 degrees. Deskew System.Int32 MaxWidth Maximum width. Required when using the Scale filter. Scale System.Int32 MaxHeight Maximum height. Required when using the Scale filter.

Remarks This method serves as an alternative way to apply multiple filters. Filters are applied in what is typically the optimal order. Exceptions Type Condition System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException Binarize() This image filter turns every pixel black or white with no middle ground. May Improve OCR performance cases of very low contrast of text to background. Declaration public OcrInput Binarize() Returns Type Description OcrInput This OcrInput object allowing for LINQ style fluent notation. Close(Boolean) Advanced Morphology. Closing is reverse of Opening, Dilation followed by Erosion. It is useful in closing small holes inside the foreground objects. Declaration public OcrInput Close(bool use3x3 = false) Parameters Type Name Description System.Boolean use3x3 2x2 is default morphology Returns Type Description OcrInput This OcrInput object allowing for LINQ style fluent notation. Contrast(Single) Increases contrast automatically. This filter often improves OCR speed and accuracy in low contrast scans. Flattens Alpha channels to white. Declaration public OcrInput Contrast(float amount = 1.1F) Parameters Type Name Description System.Single amount Amount which is used to adjust contrast. A value of 0 will create an image that is completely gray. A value of 1 leaves the input unchanged. Amount values greater than 0 increase contrast making light areas lighter and dark areas darker. Amount values less than 0 decrease contrast - decreasing variety of contrast. Returns Type Description OcrInput This OcrInput object allowing for LINQ style fluent notation. DeNoise(Boolean) Removes digital noise. This filter should only be used where noise is expected. Flattens Alpha channels to white. Declaration public OcrInput DeNoise(bool use3x3 = false) Parameters Type Name Description System.Boolean use3x3 2x2 is default morphology Returns Type Description OcrInput This OcrInput object allowing for LINQ style fluent notation. See Also Despeckle(Boolean) Deskew(Int32) Rotates an image so it is the right way up and orthogonal. This is very useful for OCR because Tesseract tolerance for skewed scans can be as low as 5 degrees. This also helps when producing searchable PDF documents from IronTesseract because the pages will likely all be the right way up. This version uses only Hough transform to make minor correction. Example: pages that where put in a scanner at a slight angle. Declaration public bool Deskew(int MaxDeskewAngle = 45) Parameters Type Name Description System.Int32 MaxDeskewAngle Maximum angle of skew to correct for. Higher values can lead to more opportunity for correction, but may be slower and more prone to error including upside down pages. Returns Type Description System.Boolean Returns a boolean result of whether or not IronOCR was able to detect image orientation. True = Deskew was applied. False = Failed to detect image orientation and image remains unchanged. See Also Rotation Despeckle(Boolean) DeSpeckle as an alias of DeNoise. Alias of DeNoise(Boolean) to make this method easily to find in Intensense. Declaration public OcrInput Despeckle(bool use3x3 = false) Parameters Type Name Description System.Boolean use3x3 2x2 is default morphology Returns Type Description OcrInput This OcrInput object allowing for LINQ style fluent notation.

Declaration public OcrInput EnhanceResolution(int TargetDPI = 225) Parameters Type Name Description System.Int32 TargetDPI The target DPI to resample to. Returns Type Description OcrInput This OcrInput object allowing for LINQ style fluent notation. Erode(Boolean) Advanced Morphology.

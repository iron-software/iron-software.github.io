IronTesseract natively supports Tesseract 3, 4 and 5 engines, and will automatically install all required binaries and language packs (tessdata) files. License Allows IronOCR license keys to be applied globally across an application. OcrFilters A collection of OCR Image filter for processing Images. OcrImageInput OCR input based on image data OcrInput Stores OCR input data and allows OCR of PDF documents or any image format. Also provides various image filter methods which can improve OCR accuracy. OcrInput.Page Represents a page within an OcrInput object. This can relate to one of many images appended, pages of a PDF or TIFF, or frames of a GIF. OcrInputBase Base class for OCR input variants OcrInputFilterWizard OcrInputFilterWizard provides a brute-force filter assessment tool to try filter combinations within IronOCR to get the highest IronTesseract confidence. Simply call the Run(String, out String, out Double, IronTesseract) method with a image filepath, and optionally a Tesseract. Out variables include the result of the best combination's read, and the best confidence. Example use: var results = OcrInputFilterWizard.Run(\"img.png\", out string text, out double confidence); OcrInputPage A full page (one image) within an OcrInput object. OcrLanguage The natural language in which OCR documents will be read. Any number of languages may be used simultaneously using the IronTessseract.AddSecondaryLanguage() Method.

OcrResult A full document object model (DOM) for results when IronTesseract reads an image or OcrInput . Gives access to Text, Pages, Words, Paragraphs, Lines, Words, Characters, Images, Barcodes, Coordinates, Font information in granular detail. OcrResult.Barcode Represents a barcode discovered during OCR. See ReadBarCodes which must be set true to use this feature. OcrResult.BarcodeEncoding Barcode Encoding Types. OcrResult.Block Represents a block of text containing zero or more paragraphs. OcrResult.Character Represents a single character (char) of text. OcrResult.Choice OcrResult.Line A line of text within an Paragraph OcrResult.OcrFont Detailed font information returned when using Tesseract OEM engine modes.

OcrResult.Page Represents a single page within an OcrResult object. OcrResult.Paragraph Represents a paragraph of text with an OcrResult object. OcrResult.Table Represents a Visual Table with Borders discovered during OCR. To enable table reading, set IronTesseract 's Configuration.ReadDataTables to true. var Ocr = new IronTesseract(); Ocr.Configuration.ReadDataTables = true; OcrResult.TextFlow Describes text direction OcrResult.Word Represents a Word discovered during OCR. OpenCvClient Client layer for OpenCV interop OrientationConfidence PdfContents PDF input target options; determines what to OCR from within the PDF ResultHighlightType ResultHighlightType defines what highlighting mode to use for HighlightTextAndSaveAsImages(IronTesseract, String, ResultHighlightType) .

May Improve OCR performance cases of very low contrast of text to background. Declaration public const OcrFilters Binarize Field Value Type Description OcrFilters Close Advanced Morphology. Opposite of Open Closing is reverse of Opening, Dilation followed by Erosion. It is useful in closing small holes inside the foreground objects. Declaration public const OcrFilters Close Field Value Type Description OcrFilters Contrast Increases contrast automatically. This filter often improves OCR speed and accuracy in low contrast scans. Amount which is used to adjust contrast. A value of 0 will create an image that is completely gray. A value of 1 leaves the input unchanged. Amount values greater than 0 increase contrast making light areas lighter and dark areas darker. Amount values less than 0 decrease contrast - decreasing variety of contrast.

Flattens Alpha channels to white. Declaration public const OcrFilters DeNoise Field Value Type Description OcrFilters Deskew Rotates an image so it is the right way up and orthogonal . This is very useful for OCR because Tesseract tolerance for skewed scans can be as low as 5 degrees. This also helps when producing searchable PDF documents from IronTesseract because the pages will likely all be the right way up. This version uses only Hough transform to make minor correction. Example: pages that where put in a scanner at a slight angle. Declaration public const OcrFilters Deskew Field Value Type Description OcrFilters Dilate Advanced Morphology. Opposite of Erode .

Remarks This method serves as an alternative way to apply multiple filters. Filters are applied in what is typically the optimal order. Exceptions Type Condition System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException Binarize() This image filter turns every pixel black or white with no middle ground. May Improve OCR performance cases of very low contrast of text to background. Declaration public OcrInputBase Binarize() Returns Type Description OcrInputBase This OcrInput object allowing for LINQ style fluent notation. Close(Boolean) Advanced Morphology.

Declaration public OcrInputBase Contrast(float amount = 1.1F) Parameters Type Name Description System.Single amount Amount which is used to adjust contrast. A value of 0 will create an image that is completely gray. A value of 1 leaves the input unchanged. Amount values greater than 0 increase contrast making light areas lighter and dark areas darker. Amount values less than 0 decrease contrast - decreasing variety of contrast. Returns Type Description OcrInputBase This OcrInput object allowing for LINQ style fluent notation. DeNoise(Boolean) Removes digital noise. This filter should only be used where noise is expected. Flattens Alpha channels to white.

See Also Despeckle(Boolean) Deskew(Int32) Rotates an image so it is the right way up and orthogonal. This is very useful for OCR because Tesseract tolerance for skewed scans can be as low as 5 degrees. This also helps when producing searchable PDF documents from IronTesseract because the pages will likely all be the right way up. This version uses only Hough transform to make minor correction. Example: pages that where put in a scanner at a slight angle. Declaration public bool Deskew(int MaxDeskewAngle = 45) Parameters Type Name Description System.Int32 MaxDeskewAngle Maximum angle of skew to correct for.

# IronSoftware.System.Drawing

`IronSoftware.System.Drawing` (henceforth referred to as "`IronSoftware.Drawing`" or "IronDrawing") is an open-source library originally developed by Iron Software that helps C# Software Engineers to replace `System.Drawing.Common in .NET projects on Windows, macOS and Linux platforms in .NET 5 and above.

IronDrawing features an intdduuitive API for instances of and conversion of bitmaps (called `AnyBitmap`), rectangles (called `CropRectangle`), colors (called `Color`), and fonts (called `Fonts`).
